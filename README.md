# Addon Dev - Blender Addon for Live Reloading

Addon Dev is a powerful tool for Blender addon developers, providing easy live reloading functionality. It streamlines the development process by allowing you to update and reload your addons without restarting Blender.

## Features

- Works with both single .py files and full addon directories
- Automatically copies addon files to Blender's addon directory
- Enables the addon in Blender after copying
- Supports multiple addons simultaneously
- Provides a convenient interface in the Python Console header

## How It Works

Addon Dev copies your addon files (either a single .py file or an entire directory) to Blender's addon folder and then enables the addon within Blender. This allows you to make changes to your addon files in your preferred editor, and then quickly reload the addon in Blender to see the changes.

## Location in Blender

You can find the Addon Dev interface in the header of the Python Console. Look for the "Addon Dev" button next to the "Console" button.

## Installation

1. Download the Addon Dev .zip file
2. Open Blender and go to Edit > Preferences
3. Click on the "Add-ons" section
4. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded .zip file
5. Enable the addon by checking the box next to "Development: Addon Dev"

## Usage

1. Click on the "Addon Dev" button in the Python Console header
2. Use the "Add" or "Add single .py" button to add your addon to the development list
3. Make changes to your addon files in your preferred editor
4. Click "Update All" in the Addon Dev interface or use the keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Shift+R) to reload your addons

Enjoy a smoother, more efficient addon development process with Addon Dev!
